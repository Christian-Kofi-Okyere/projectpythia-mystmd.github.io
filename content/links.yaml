    Introduction to Python for Atmospheric Science & Meteorology. Unidata is working to create a collection of online training materials focused on the use of Python in the atmospheric sciences. While our examples and scenarios may feature Unidata tools and data technologies, our aim is to present a generic set of freely available tools that are generally useful to scientists, educators, and students in the geosciences, broadly defined.

    This book grew out of a course developed at Columbia University called Research Computing in Earth Science. It was written mostly by Ryan Abernathey, with significant contributions from Kerry Key. By separating the book from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for python education in the Earth and Environmental Sciences.
